Once you have prepared the data, once you have modeled and analyzed the data,
you have a set of insights and you want to communicate them. When communicating them, the
two things that really matter are how you show it and how you tell it. The show part is effectively
how you design the output and tools for that are what this module will cover, and how you tell it,
which is a storytelling part. And the tools for that are what the next module will cover.
When it comes to designing the output. Data visualization plays a pretty important part
in this, but it is not the only aspect of design. And specifically, within that dashboards are

one of the most common ways of communicating data, they are certainly not necessarily the best way,
they are the most common way that data and models are presented today. And this module
will cover some of the tools that are often used when presenting data as dashboards.
There are two kinds of tools that we will be covering the general-purpose tools and
the Specialized tools. The general-purpose tools have the advantage that they cover
the majority of the ways in which data is presented the most common ways in particular,
but the specialized tools usually fit a certain purpose. They are not useful everywhere.
But there are certain things that they do extremely well. And we will be covering a
few of those. On the general-purpose tools side, we will start with Excel, giving you sense of how
you can create certain visualizations, unusual visualizations, nontraditional visualizations,
and create many dashboards with Excel. We will spend some time on BI tools such
as Google Data Studio, Power BI and Tableau as vehicles for you to create data visualizations
and get familiar with. These are the tools that are used most commonly out there in the world. So,
a familiarity with these tools will come in handy when you are presenting data of any kind.
But these apart, there are some specialized tools that you should be aware of.
The first of these is Excel itself, which can go well beyond the traditional charts that you have.
And you will see some examples of how you can create some fairly non standard charts in Excel,
including, for example, how we would create the store layout of harrots and look at how
the people move in and out just within Excel. When it comes to animated charts, Flourish Studio
is an excellent tool, which helps you create charts like a bar chart, race or
motion chart. And using a set of standard templates with data that you can upload,
you can create far richer animations than you otherwise would in many other tools.
Kumu, is a tool that is specialized towards network visualizations.
When you have a graph of elements that are connected to each other, let us say if you have
movie actors and their co-stars as a network, or people on Twitter who are following each other
as a network. These are the kinds of visualizations that you typically want
to represent as a network diagram. And Kumu is one of the tools that excels at that.
For geographic visualizations, you often want to process the data. And you also want to potentially
color code parts of a map in different ways. And for this, a tool, like QGIS is invaluable.
We have not necessarily gone in for the breadth of specialized tools, there are several of those. The
intent of this module is to introduce you to a few tools that do a good job of visualizing specific
kinds of specialized visualizations, so that you get a sense that you can use
different tools for different purposes, and pick the best for your solution.
But the most important thing that you should learn from this particular module is.
A) how one goes about picking the right kind of tool for what you want. And this is something
that becomes much easier as you get more and more familiar. The short answer to the question,
how do you pick the right tool is whatever you are most familiar with, that can get the job done,
and therefore increasing your familiarity is one of the most powerful things that you can do.
The second thing that you should learn from this is the tool is only a means
to an end. You have got a learn how exactly you want to design the output so that the audience
understands is better. That is not what this course is teaching you. It is teaching you
familiarity with the tools, but I do hope you remember that this is just a stepping stone
towards helping the audience understand what data you have.
