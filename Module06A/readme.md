Once you have prepared the data, once you have modeled and analyzed the data,
you have a set of insights and you want to communicate them. When communicating them, the
two things that really matter are how you show it and how you tell it. The show part is effectively
how you design the output and tools for that are what this module will cover, and how you tell it,
which is a storytelling part.
